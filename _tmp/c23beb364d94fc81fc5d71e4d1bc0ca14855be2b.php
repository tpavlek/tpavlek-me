*I previously wrote all about Edmonton City Council compensation [here](/blog/2016/02/05/how-much-is-edmonton-city-council-paid/).*

In the 2017 federal budget, there was an unexpected inclusion on [page 208](http://www.budget.gc.ca/2017/docs/plan/budget-2017-en.pdf) (pdf).

Edmonton City Council currently receives 1/3 of their salary tax-free, and the Federal government is now ending that benefit.

<div class="council-motion">
    <p>
    Remove the tax exemptions for non-accountable expense allowances paid to members of provincial and territorial legislative assemblies and to certain municipal office-holders. This exemption is only available to certain provincial, territorial and municipal office holders, and provides an advantage that other Canadians do not enjoy.
    </p>

As a reminder, Council's salary is set by an independent committee, and in 2013 they gave recommendations about how councillors should be
paid. One of their recommendations was that *council's salary should be fully taxable*. This was the only recommendation
from the independent committee that city council decided not to enact. I guess their hand is forced now ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

|                      | Mayor           | Councillor      | 
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Salary               | $173,269 (-$<span style="color:red">44,931</span>)        | $98,362 (-$<span style="color:red">18,367</span>)       |  
| RRSP Contribution    | $19,059.59      | $10,819.82      |
| Vehicle Allowance    | $14,457.36 (-$<span style="color:red">3,814.80</span>)     | $7,216.20 (-$<span style="color:red">1,388.64</span>)         |
| Transition Allowance | $9,996.28      | $5674.73       |
| **Total**            | **$216,782.23** (-$<span style="color:red">48,745.80</span>) | **$122,072.75** (-$<span style="color:red">19,755.64</span>) |

(**Note**: These salary numbers are based on the [already reduced](http://globalnews.ca/news/3169610/edmonton-city-councillors-salaries-decrease-for-2017/) council salaries for 2017)

The justification for this 1/3 tax exemption for politicians was initially to cover out-of-pocket expenses that a councillor
might pay to work with his or her constituents and office. This has long since been covered by expense accounts, however,
so the tax free portion was simply a salary-bump-by-another-name.

What will be interesting is the City's response to this decrease: will council move to increase their salaries by a commensurate
amount, or will they effectively have their pay reduced due to this new federal budget. For now, we can only wait and see.


**Update**: This change won't take effect until 2019
