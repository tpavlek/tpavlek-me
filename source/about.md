            Troy Pavlek is a software developer and passionate candidate for Edmonton City Council in Ward 11.
        <p>
            He's President
            of the Hazeldean Community League, where he's working hard to make the community more safe and livable by pursuing
            speed limit changes to 40 km/h.

        <p>
            He believes in municipal government should be 100% accountable for their decisions on issues. While other candidates
            might tout transparency, Troy is the only candidate who has <a href="https://yegvotes.info">built a website
            using the open data catalogue to make it easy to track councillor voting records and attendance</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He believes in communicating any way he can. Whether that's through the typical avenues like emails and websites,
            or using social media like Facebook or Twitter. He can even communicate in your car on your commute, via his
            municipal policy podcast <a href="https://basketofyegs.com">Basket of YEGs</a>.
        </p>
