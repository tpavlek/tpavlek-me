My girlfriend is epic. Instead of getting be crappy generic gifts for my birthday, which is in three days, I was 
consulted as to what I would want the most. I already had the idea in my head, for an awesomely nerdy shirt on so many 
levels.

It should be noted that I'm a slight Google fanboy - I have a Nexus One, which in my eyes is the only true Google phone 
(Nexus S be damned!). All my pictures are on Picasa, my blog is hosted on blogger, I do all my written work in docs. 
In every aspect of my life that Google can have a part, it does. And so, when Google got all up'n Bing's business with 
the [Hiybbprqag shenanigans](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/microsofts-bing-uses-google-search.html), I naturally 
had a small google fanboy orgasm in my room.

Needless to say, a hiybbprqag shirt would be many levels of epic, so that's what I got. Pictures are as follows:

{% include 'image.html.twig' with {
    'name': 'frontside.jpg', 
    'caption': 'Frontside. The scanned code reads "hiybbprqag"'
} %}

{% include 'image.html.twig' with {
    'name': 'backside.jpg', 
    'caption': 'Backside'
} %}
