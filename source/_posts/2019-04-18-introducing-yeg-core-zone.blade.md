A new, community-driven idea will be presented to Edmonton City Council's Community and Public Services Committee on April 24th,
the **#YEGCoreZone**

> So what is the #YEGCoreZone?

In a nutshell, the Core Zone will allow us to pragmatically and rapidly implement livable, safe streets in the core
areas of the city. With a focus on quick, efficient implementation, according to research done by the City of Edmonton
we could see up to 39% reduction in collisions on our local roadways, and reduce the severity of the collisions that do occur.

For a long time, Edmontonians discussed speed limits and speed reductions, often with intense passion or vitriol.
We saw this with the city's implementation of playground zones. When the city attempted a blanket approach, pushback forced 
council to revert the zones in some scenarios where they didn't make sense and frustrated drivers.

At the same time, advocates for safety in the city have rightly pointed out the massive increase in survivability of collisions
at 30km/h compared to 50km/h, as well as the ease and comfort of walking, cycling and playing along streets that have calmed
traffic. Walking along a sidewalk directly beside a road with trucks moving at 50km/h can be a lot scarier than walking along
one with traffic moving at slower, community-appropriate speeds.

Most recently, council has proposed a motion that would have a blanket approach, and apply 40km/h limits to all *local, residential* roadways.
This would not apply to any collector or arterial roadways. This approach has several downsides.

1. It doesn't help *very much*. 40km/h is better than 50, but we know that 30km/h is a safe speed for areas where people 
live and use the streets in active, shared ways.
2. It doesn't apply to collector roadways, where residents tend to have the most concern about speeds.
3. It doesn't address the criticism about suburban contexts. Many complain that new developments have wider roadways and 
are designed for higher speeds than the old, mature neighbourhood roads so a blanket solution might not be best.
4. It doesn't propose any way to increase compliance other than what we've already been doing, signs and photo radar.

The solution we are proposing to these issues is the Core Zone. We would take the dense areas in the centre of the city
that tend to have far more active transportation mode use like walking, cycling and using public transportation and draw
a line around them. This line would be drawn along major arterial roadways so it's easy to know when you've entered and left
the zone.

Within the zone, we would propose that all local residential roadways would be 30km/h and all collector roadways (roads
that are designed to "collect" neighbourhood traffic and move it to an arterial road) would be 40km/h.

Arterial roadways would not change within the Core Zone.

                              </ul>'
])

While simply changing the speed limits *does* have a positive effect - we've seen that in Edmonton communities that have trialed
a default 40km/h speed limit - posting signs is not enough. That's key with the Core Zone proposal.

Areas within the Core Zone tend to have narrower, mature streets, with on-street parking and trees that give drivers the sense
that they should be moving slower. Where the streets might communicate a higher design speed, it is imperative that we
implement quick, effective and *inexpensive* design solutions that are proven to naturally slow down drivers.

Speeds in the Core Zone shouldn't need to be enforced via Photo Radar. The road should communicate the safe speed to drivers
leading to natural compliance. Given the limited size of the Core Zone, city administration will be more able to implement
these solutions quickly and broadly in the zone - to prove that they work.

@include('_partials.image', [ 'name' => 'tactical-urbanism.jpg', 'caption' => 'Some examples of inexpensive roadway treatments to increase safety' ])

There's already precedent for this. The neighbourhood of Strathcona, which is undergoing neighbourhood renewal in the coming
years has voted overwhelmingly to lower their speed limits to 30km/h and crucially, for the roadways to reflect a *design speed*
of 30km/h. Council has already voted to approve this design speed.

These changes won't solve everything. But they're a start, something that Edmonton has not done much of since it adopted
Vision Zero in 2015. The debate on speed reduction has been ongoing for several years, with council continually kicking the can
to "decide later". Meanwhile, by the city's own data and projections, every time we wait we're causing *material harm* to 
residents.

@include('_partials.image', [ 'name' => 'collision-reductions.jpg', 'caption' => 'Data from the city of Edmonton projecting the reduction in collisions from these speed changes' ])

Where the current council motion proposes to do nothing with residential collectors and target a 6-9% reduction in collisions
on local roadways, the Core Zone would take a more ambitious approach, reducing collisions up to 39% on local roadways and 6-9% on collectors.

If you support the idea of a rapidly-implemented Core Zone, please write your city councillor and let them know.

We will be presenting our proposal to Council on April 24th.

## Addressing Criticisms

> The Core Zone is not ambitious enough, collectors should be 30km/h too!

I agree, and I hope there's a path to getting there. However, a year ago City Council directed administration to look 
at the different types of roadways we have in Edmonton and recommend some maximum speed limits based on how the road looks
and functions. That work did not get completed and won't be completed until this September *at the earliest*. Unfortunately,
right now collectors, even in the core, are not made equal.

@include('_partials.image', [ 'name' => 'classifications.jpg', 'caption' => 'Both of these roadways are classified "Residential-Collector"' ])

This is another pragmatic decision of the Core Zone proposal. We need action **now, without delay**. Waiting for roadway
reclassification would cause too much of a delay in implementation. The Core Zone proposal will suggest lowering speeds
on neighbourhood-context collectors with only two lanes and homes on both sides once that reclassification work can be
completed.

> The Core Zone is arbitrary. It should have included community [x]

I'm glad you want safe speeds in other communities as well. This criticism is pretty fair, overall. The boundaries of the
Core Zone were chosen because:

1. They represent mostly-similar mature areas with similar street types and design
2. They cover the areas in the city where active and public transportation have the highest proportion of use
3. They are along major, easily identifiable arterial roads, which make it simple to locate the zone
4. They represent areas that have shown demand for traffic calming in the past.

Other areas absolutely might be at home in the Core Zone - and I would be ecstatic if it wasn't a zone at all, but simply
a safe city. Unfortunately, this comes down to politics. Many suburban councillors will not vote for a proposal that applies a
blanket approach, and many wider community roadways on the edges of the city would require more costly interventions than the
Core Zone is proposing. That costs money - money which absolutely _should_ be allocated, but money which our current council 
has made clear _won't_ be allocated to traffic safety in the near future.

I would be happy if council decides to expand the boundaries of the Core Zone. But, because perfect shouldn't be the enemy of
good, and because we **need** to make forward progress, having a community clamour to be _included_ is preferable to having
communities clamour to be _excluded_.

> This doesn't do much for safety Downtown

You're absolutely right, and that's a critical and ironic flaw of the *Core Zone*. The downtown core itself is almost all
arterial roadways with some collectors.

This issue is a longstanding one in Edmonton and addresses a city planning question of who our downtown streets are *for*,
people living and using them in a variety of active ways, or people driving through. The Core Zone simply can't address
the scope of that problem, but thankfully some other projects like Imagine Jasper and our LRT construction are improving 
and increasing the livability around some of those roadways.

The Core Zone would absolutely love to make downtown streets more livable - 102 ave and 100ave which both recently had separated
bike lanes installed come to mind as fantastic starting points. However, with their arterial classification, our hands
are tied until the city does roadway reclassification work. In the interim, delaying the Core Zone until that reclassification
is done doesn't make sense.
