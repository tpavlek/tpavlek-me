I'm confused more than I thought was humanly possible.

For the last month, I've taken up a summer job at the University of Alberta, interning and doing some programming work. 
It's mostly PHP and javascript error checking, so on one hand I'm barfing in my mouth thinking about it, but on the other 
hand, it's easy work all day and it pays money dollars, so that's nice. But this post isn't about the work I do there, 
it's about what I saw on my lunch break.

During the summer, because people aren't in school for the most part, the University plays host to a load of summer 
camps for kids aged 8-14. It was in respect to three girls aged around nine or so that my confusion is directed. 
Here's what happened:

It was my lunch break and I was out on the quad, chilling and enjoying myself when I spotted these three nine year old 
girls engaging in rather peculiar activities. They were positioned in a triangle with one girl, we'll call her Susie, 
at the peak, and both ends of the isosceles sides being formed by Lara and Joanna respectively. However, 
tied around Lara and Joanna's waists was a rainbow skipping rope each, the opposite end in the hand of Susie. 
Lara and Joanna were on their hands and knees.

I've taken the liberty of drawing the situation off to the left. You might think that Lara is purple, but you'd be wrong. 
Lara is in fact green.

Now, kids will be kids, and I mean maybe Susie had some sort of Dominatrix-bestiality fetish and was simply exacting 
such desires onto her submissive lesbian friends. That is one option, however, I'm going to discredit that solely on the 
basis that I feel like such assumptions, when broadcasted, can lead to my inevitible arrest (it was due to this same fear 
that I neglected to take any photographs of the situation). However, the situation did not end here, because at this 
point in time Susie proceeded to take a frisbee (by temporarily transferring both of the what I assume to be leashes to 
one hand) and throw it in front ot Lara and Joanna. This prompted a savage pulling by the two, which eventually dragged 
Susie forward until they both had approached the frisbee. They then proceeded to grab onto the frisbee _with their teeth_ 
and play tug of war, while Susie seemed to be pulling on their leashes with all her might. I just... I don't understand 
the situation at all. I defer to the internet - perhaps someone could be able to delve into the ugly depths of child 
psychology and give me an explanation for these shenanigans, because I'm at a total loss.

I don't _think_ I was that much of a freak as a child.
