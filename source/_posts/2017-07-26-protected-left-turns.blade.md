Anyone commuting via 63 ave has experienced the feeling before. You're in the left-turn lane at 99st, there's about eight or nine cars
in front of you and just as you're pulling to the front during the advance phase, the light turns yellow and you're **stuck there**.

For a whole light cycle.

Might as well get out and walk home.

While door-knocking recently a resident brought that up as his primary concern - it was frustrating to him for another reason:
at midnight, when he's driving home, if there are no cars waiting to turn, the left-turn phase is skipped entirely, so he
always has to wait with empty roads for his chance to turn.

I empathized with him, but told him the solution in place was better than what he was asking for, and I'd be happy to share why.

// PUT IN PHOTO OF THE INTERSECTION

On December 17, 2010, a protected left-turn phase was installed on the intersection at 99st and 63ave. This was in response to
several years of collisions.

In the seven years prior to implementation, there were 36 injury and 96 property damage collisions related to left turning vehicles
at that intersection. That means on average, **left turns at that intersection were causing around nineteen collisions per year**.
