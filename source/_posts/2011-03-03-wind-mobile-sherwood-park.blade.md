I've been on WIND for just over eight months now, and I figured I should post up my general feelings about it. So to 
start off, this review applies mostly to Edmonton/Sherwood Park, so don't ask me questions about Toronto.

Firstly, coverage. Coverage is great. And by great I mean, that within their declared coverage areas, they cover you. 
I've not found many exceptions to this (except on third floor parking basements), so that's great. My house itself, is 
about a half kilometre out of the coverage zone, and the coverage is occasionally spotty, but usually good. All in all, 
in the coverage zone, it's super, outside, not so much. For more information you can always check out 
[Coverage Mapper](http://coveragemapper.com/).

Onto the more general aspects of WIND: the company itself. I have really mixed feelings. I've called WIND a few times, 
and I will say, the outsourced call centre is _useless_. Thoroughly and completely useless. But, in all the times I've 
called WIND, I've only got the outsourced centre once. The other times, I've gotten the Canadian call centres, and they 
were very helpful and usually pretty knowledgeable.

WIND definitely still feels like a new company (and I feel this has slightly extended its stay). Last week the account 
info and usage tracking went down. Without explanation, without notice, close to my billing date. It's still down now, 
at least 7 days later. Not pleased.

I'm able to excuse this, however, because of the constant undervaluing of their services. I'm currently on the 
Irresistible35 plan, which is essentially Unlimited _everything_ including data for $35/mo. I enjoy this plan.

Overall, I would probably only give WIND about a 7/10, perhaps less, but still highly recommend them should you have 
data needs (which everyone really should). If you live within a coverage area, check them out.
