When my sitting city councillor Mike Nickel pondered if there was 
"[any insight to the allegations of fanatics aiming to skew the numbers](http://www.mikenickel.ca/bike-lane-measurement-lacking/)"
in regards to the downtown bike grid measurement, he had no idea how close he was to the truth.

We now have video evidence of radical bike lobbyists implementing Don Iveson's anti-car agenda and skewing the stats in their
favour.

Why hasn't this news been widely circulated? Well it's all a media conspiracy organized by the sympathizer in Iveson's back pocket:
[Ryan Jespersen](https://twitter.com/ryanjespersen/status/1004392964976570368).

When asked about this salacious evidence, Nickel responded: 

> "Oh, what? City-related stuff? I'm already a whole seven months into my term, so I'm focusing on getting a different job".
