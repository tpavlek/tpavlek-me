It's been a while since the FGT Open BETA 1 (the second has just come and gone) so this post is much later than it 
deserves to be, but delays are delays and I didn't want to post this before each of the recipients had received their 
prize in the mail. Spoilers, and all that. Who wants to see it online before you get to open the real thing in the mail 
and experience the surprise?

Another one of the prizes went to Zoku, who requested, verbatim: "a marine pooping on an infestor". 
The Terran in me was happy to oblige this request - my roomate informed me that I was too gratuitous in the 
depiction - I disagree, thought it was just right.

@include('_partials.image', ['name' => 'drop-in.jpg', 'caption' => 'Drops are a good unit' ])

Expect to see the same for BETA 2, once winners have received their prizes! It's a lot of fun! If you want to keep up 
with events like these (and maybe even win your own crayon drawing), consider following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/troypavlek)
