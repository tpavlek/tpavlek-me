Well, [the campaign disclosures are in](http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/71817.aspx) and you can
check out the [google sheet I put together with David Staples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xa1DpEIWiFMVmiWiDHyFXVUtRNrRjcHOdfXqXiFZCmE/edit) if you want full breakdowns.

## Total Campaign Cost

Excluding the self-financed candidates, who do not have to disclose how much they spent (as long as it is under $10,000), the total campaign expenditures
for all candidates is **$506,903.00**. Just over half a million dollars for this by-election.

Let's also look at the top 3 candidates to see how their spending compares. A note, candidates must only report the name, address and amount of donations
over $100. So, this in general skews the "average donation amount" metric upwards, as we cannot see the very low donation amounts.

No candidate in the election opted to be more forthcoming with their finances than the rules required.

## Moe Banga

First place, Moe Banga, spent the *most* out of all candidates at **$78,890**, which ended up costing him $33.44 per vote. He brought in a lot of votes and
money. His average donation (over $100) was $1,164.52.

## Laura Thibert

Laura is a *very* interesting candidate in this race because she spent *very little*. Her total clocked in at **$12,759**. That puts her at a much lower
$9.94 per vote. This per vote total is the third-lowest out of all the candidates, the only candidates lower than that were Lincoln Ho, who spent $784 to get 146 votes
and Dan Johnstone who spent $4,000 to get 436 votes. This in stark contrast to Laura's second-place 1283 votes.

She's also apparently feeling the Bern with **$309.93** being her average over-$100 donation, much lower than competitors in her echelon of vote totals.

## Arundeep Singh Sandhu

Arundeep is an interesting case as well. He spent just shy of Moe Banga, with **$75,800**, however since he only got half of Moe's votes,
his total spent per vote was $68.54.

His average over-$100 donation was a decently high $1500.

## Honourable Mentions

There are some honourable mentions for campaign spending. 

Mike Butler takes the highest spending per vote with **$96.40**. This earned him 371 votes. He also had an incredible high average donation of $3120 - but he only had five donators, three of which gave the $5000 maximum.

R. Joey Koopmans takes the honourable mention for lowest disclosed spending. He disclosed $100 spent (the cost of his nomination) which he was unable to make back, since he only got five votes.
