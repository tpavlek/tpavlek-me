When I decided to run for city council, one thing I was uncompromising on is that it wouldn't make me boring.

I'm an active user of the internet, while some view memes, I was forged in a pit of the dankest memes. That's why I was
so excited when I saw clips of Carla Frost in the mayoral debates, it allowed me the opportunity to makes some very fun
videos.

City News even went so far as to offer some coverage on the memeification of the city council race.
