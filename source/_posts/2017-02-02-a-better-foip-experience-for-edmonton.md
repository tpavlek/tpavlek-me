At this week's Executive Committee, I took the time to attend and speak about the city's FOIP process.

The Freedom of Information Process is hugely important to me - I believe a truly [Open City](/open-city) is the only
way for Edmonton to keep up with the rapidly changing world. And while I think most pieces of data should be in the 
Open Data catalogue or made available as routine disclosures, when data is _not_ available by default FOIP is the
only available recourse left to citizens.

You can listen to the entirety of my comments and the subsequent councillor questions below:

In questioning administration about some of the issues I had, the city manager straight up admitted that even *her* office
does not have the best knowledge of the FOIP process and what is and isn't releasable. The problems were identified as
a systemic education issue that needs to be rectified.

And she, commendably, committed to doing so.

On the Council side of the room, Mayor Don Iveson was very receptive to my suggestions of a more "concierge-like" FOIP
process - wherein the FOIP co-ordinators are in active communication with the requester throughout the process, even if
the request feels clear and specific.

FOIP remains an invaluable tool that arms citizens with the greatest possible weapon: _knowledge_. I'll be closely monitoring
administration's progress as improvements and education are made on the FOIP process - you can rest assured
that as your City Councillor in Ward 11, I'll enact policy that FOIP co-ordinators should ensure requesters
get what they _want_, even when it doesn't directly map to what they _asked for_.

> The best way to learn what people want is to simply *ask*.

The City of Edmonton has undergone reorganization to break down silos that prevented communication; we need to make sure
the City **itself** has open lines of communication with the public. And that starts with the FOIP co-ordinators picking
up the phone and saying hello.
