Charlie Sheen is a kind of man-love guy for me. While I've never seen him actually doing any good acting or such things, 
and I generally hate all of the productions the fellow is involved in, it's completely unavoidable that in light of the 
current shenanigans he's gotten himself into, there is but one fact that remains consistent: _that guy makes me want to 
do cocaine._ I mean, seriously, just look at that guy, he's a friggin' rockstar from mars - a warlock in our realm.

As such it is only fitting that I bless him with the wonders that is my crayon art, and in an act of fanboyism, write him a love-haiku:


<p style="font-style:italic;">
    A warlock trapped with <br />
    Tiger's blood thick on my lips <br />
    Thousand suns. WINNING.<br />
