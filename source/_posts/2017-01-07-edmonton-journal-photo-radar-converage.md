The Edmonton Journal (and Sun) released a piece covering my position on the Photo Radar program and detailed some stat-based reforms that
need to be enacted. They also included a video of me describing some of my conclusions based on the stats available.

Check out the piece on [http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/stats-suggest-more-photo-radar-dollars-should-be-spent-on-infrastructure-fixes-council-hopeful-says](http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/stats-suggest-more-photo-radar-dollars-should-be-spent-on-infrastructure-fixes-council-hopeful-says).

If you would like to view the blog post that inspired the Journal article you can find that at [Edmonton Photo Radar Statistics for 2016](/blog/2017/01/05/edmonton-photo-radar-statisitics-for-2016/).
