Well, that was fun. For those that didn't tune in or realize, [FGT]starcraft recently held our beta tournament (beta as 
in our tournament software - it was Wings of Liberty not HoTS Beta). Overall the tournament went pretty smoothly - 
there were a few programming hiccups but those will be addressed in their own post that will be put up soon; this one 
will deal primarily with the Starcraft side of things.

For those interested in watching the tournament, in its entirety, you can view it below

Now that we're all on the same page, I want to put my cards on the table: I fucked up. The software wasn't ready for 
primetime and wasn't as feature complete as I wanted it to be. That became apparent as soon as the first person had a 
nonstandard situation and my site shat itself and offered no helpful input. But a few site issues aside, this was a great 
turnout. I expected, maybe, 12 people to show up, maybe one of them masters. What actually happened is I got 27 people 
several of them high masters or even grandmasters players. The winner, Zoku, was well into grandmasters and also of note 
was FXOSirRobin. In the round of 16 FGThjklzEX from our own team went head to head with SirRobin, and, Robin being the 
good sport he is, he made it a pretty interesting, if somewhat, trollish game. If you only check out one game, make it 
that one (it's in Part 1).

Another set of interesting games were the finals, a best of five between Zoku and rgScythe - in which there was fantastic 
play shown by both players. Zoku showed an intensive knowledge of abusive positions for terrans to take advantage of, 
on a wide variety of maps. He also showed off incredible micro, especially with medivacs and marines. rgScythe was no 
slouch, however, showing incredible macro and was almost always half-a-building-CC ahead of his opponent. Those games 
are obviously the last ones in the VOD so make sure to check those out too, should you be interested.

Like mentioned earlier, there is some heavy work left to be done on the site, and I'll attempt to complete most of that 
before hosting another tournament - but not to worry it will happen again, as soon as I can! In the meantime you can

Until next time, ar gt!
