A new, community-driven idea will be presented to Edmonton City Council's Community and Public Services Committee on April 24th,
the **#YEGCoreZone**

> So what is the #YEGCoreZone?

In a nutshell, the Core Zone will allow us to pragmatically and rapidly implement livable, safe streets in the core
areas of the city.

For a long time, Edmontonians discussed speed limits and speed reductions, often with intense passion or vitriol.
We saw this with the city's implementation of playground zones. When the city attempted a blanket approach, pushback forced 
council to revert the zones in some scenarios where they didn't make sense and frustrated drivers.

At the same time, advocates for safety in the city have rightly pointed out the massive increase in survivability of collisions
at 30km/h compared to 50km/h, as well as the ease and comfort of walking, cycling and playing along streets that have calmed
traffic. Walking along a sidewalk directly beside a road with trucks moving at 50km/h can be a lot scarier than walking along
one with traffic moving at slower, community-appropriate speeds.

Most recently, council has proposed a motion that would have a blanket approach, and apply 40km/h limits to all *local, residential* roadways.
This would not apply to any collector or arterial roadways. This approach has several downsides.

1. It doesn't help *very much*. 40km/h is better than 50, but we know that 30km/h is a safe speed for areas where people 
live and use the streets in active, shared ways.
2. It doesn't apply to collector roadways, where residents tend to have the most concern about speeds.
3. It doesn't address the criticism about suburban contexts. Many complain that new developments have wider roadways and 
are designed for higher speeds than the old, mature neighbourhood roads so a blanket solution might not be best.
4. It doesn't propose any way to increase compliance other than what we've already been doing, signs and photo radar.

The solution we are proposing to these issues is the Core Zone. We would take the dense areas in the centre of the city
that tend to have far more active transportation mode use like walking, cycling and using public transportation and draw
a line around them. This line would be drawn along major arterial roadways so it's easy to know when you've entered and left
the zone.

Within the zone, we would propose that all local residential roadways would be 30km/h and all collector roadways (roads
that are designed to "collect" neighbourhood traffic and move it to an arterial road) would be 40km/h.

Arterial roadways would not change within the Core Zone.

])

While simply changing the speed limits *does* have a positive effect - we've seen that in Edmonton communities that have trialed
a default 40km/h speed limit - posting signs is not enough. That's key with the Core Zone proposal.

Areas within the Core Zone tend to have narrower, mature streets, with on-street parking and trees that give drivers the sense
that they should be moving slower. Where the streets might communicate a higher design speed, it is imperative that we
implement quick, effective and *inexpensive* design solutions that are proven to naturally slow down drivers.

Speeds in the Core Zone shouldn't need to be enforced via Photo Radar. The road should communicate the safe speed to drivers
leading to natural compliance. Given the limited size of the Core Zone, city administration will be more able to implement
these solutions quickly and broadly in the zone - to prove that they work.

There's already precedent for this. The neighbourhood of Strathcona, which is undergoing neighbourhood renewal in the coming
years has voted overwhelmingly to lower their speed limits to 30km/h and crucially, for the roadways to reflect a *design speed*
of 30km/h. Council has already voted to approve this design speed.

These changes won't solve everything. But they're a start, something that Edmonton has not done much of since it adopted
Vision Zero in 2015. The debate on speed reduction has been ongoing for several years, with council continually kicking the can
to "decide later". Meanwhile, by the city's own data and projections, every time we wait we're causing *material harm* to 
residents.

The Core Zone is not perfect. It doesn't solve everything for everyone. But, critically, it's politically palatable. Suburban
councillors can vote for it, without losing their seats. It moves us forward.

So let's move forward with the Core Zone. It will be presented to council on April 24th. If you support progress on making
safer streets for Edmontonians, please write your councillor and let them know.

Let's take back the streets for every Edmontonian, whether they're in a car or not.
