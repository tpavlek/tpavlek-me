*This is part of a continuing series recounting what City Council does each week. You can see last week's post [here](/blog/2017/02/03/this-week-city-council-jan-30-feb-3/).*

The program which made winter sand available at community leagues around the city was cut in the 2016 operational budget,
but thanks to a motion from Ward 10 Councillor Michael Walters it will be making [its triumphant return](http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/city-council-to-bring-back-sandbox-program-1.3275374).

The boxes will be re-installed at most community leagues next week, then filled with sand the week after.

After a [supreme court ruling](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/no-moment-of-reflection-at-edmonton-city-council-1.3800422) which
which determined that starting council meetings with prayer was unconstitutional, city council meetings will no longer have
a _moment of reflection_ beginning each meeting. The motion passed near-unanimously, with only the Ward 11 Councillor Mike Nickel voting against.

Councillor Andrew Knack's motion to explore [intermodal transit hubs](http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/city-councillor-pushes-for-transportation-hub-in-light-of-remote-greyhound-terminal)
passed with additions to include the province in the discussions. The greyhound station's location - noticeably missing both bus service
and _sidewalks_ - was a rather embarrassing trigger for these discussions.

105 Avenue was supposed to have a wonderful pedestrian and bike-friendly urban environment - it was one of the campaign
promises of Stephen Mandel back in 2004. Those plans have fallen by the wayside and Ward 6 Councillor Scott McKeen is
now [asking what the delay has been](http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/bitterly-disappointed-developer-wants-answers-on-north-edge-failures)
in hopes that it can be reprioritized for the next round of capital budgets.

Councillor Mike Nickel wanted to learn more about the [City of Edmonton Reorganization](http://blog.mastermaq.ca/2016/01/28/the-city-of-edmonton-is-reorganizing-in-support-of-functional-integration/).
His motion asked administration to come back with an answer on what the cost has been to the city in implementing this re-organization
and what metrics are set for determining whether the re-organization was a "success". 

The third part of his motion, which had some contention, asked
who, beyond the city manager is accountable for achieving these metrics and what is the target date for achieving them.
Ward 3 Councillor Dave Loken drew issue with the naming of names in the motion - since City Council only has _one_ employee, the City Manageer,
it was deemed inappropriate to ask for reporting on other specific City of Edmonton Employees. The rest of Council agreed,
and the motion passed with an amendment asking what _departments_ are responsible, to avoid reporting on specific employees.
