Despite very lean agendas for this week's committee meetings, Edmonton City Council got quite a bit
done.

### Mature Neighbourhood Overlay

This week Mayor Don Iveson [made infill an election issue](http://www.metronews.ca/news/edmonton/2017/02/01/edmonton-density-election-debate-mayor-don-iveson.html).

The Mature Neighbourhood Overlay, a set of zoning restrictions that apply specifically to areas of the city
that house _mature neighbourhoods_.

There were 25 speakers that registered to talk about the MNO with some saying the permitted uses went too far, and others saying
the regulation did not go far enough. [David Staples argues that the MNO is too timid](http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/david-staples-over-cautious-city-risks-regulating-infill-aspirations-to-death).

Don Iveson's motion requests administration provide a report this September outlining areas within the MNO that might
benefit from taller heights or shorter distances from the street - perhaps areas near major streets or transit corridors.
This targeted and more neighbourhood-specific infill strategy is set to become an issue for the election this October.

### FOIP Process

A report on the City's FOIP (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy) process came back to Executive Committee this
week. I spoke at the committee arguing for a more concierge-like service - you can read my thoughts on [A Better, More Welcoming FOIP Experience for Edmonton](/blog/2017/02/02/a-better-foip-experience-for-edmonton).

Frequently, when Council has an interesting question that administration does not have the answer to immediately, they provide
the answer later to Council in the form of a memo. These memos are not public, so the public and journalists are often left
in the dark about many aspects of city administration.
 
Thanks to [Elise Stolte's hard work](http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/postmedia-wins-public-access-for-edmonton-council-memos), 
these memos will now be public on an ongoing basis. Continuing the trend of increased
disclosure, administration will also draft a procedure for make private reports public when the reason for making them private
no longer applies. For example, if a report was private because it contained details about an unsigned contract, after the negotiation
is complete, there is no longer any reason to keep it private.

<div class="council-motion">
    <h2>Council Motion</h2>
    <p>
    That Administration bring forward a recommended approach, including a policy and/or Procedures and Committees Bylaw 12300 changes, to provide for continuous disclosure of memos and subsequent disclosure of private reports of Council to the public when the reason for keeping them private no longer applies.
