February of 2016 was a blisteringly cold month notable because of the 32 candidates all running in the by-election to take
the seat on Edmonton City Council vacated by Amarjeet Sohi. And like a crew of - I'm sure completely serious *candidates* - they made
debates and forums look like clown-cars as they all piled in and tried to have their voices heard.

At one point Ryan Jespersen tried to make sense of the whole thing by hosting an elimination debate show, [last candidate standing](http://www.630ched.com/2016/02/01/86259/).

Of course the **actual** last candidate standing, the winner of the election Moe Banga, was not present in the final three
of the radio debate.

Many of these candidates said they were serious and unperturbed by the loss. Just after the election, fourth-place candidate
Irfan Chaudhry spoke on [the Basket of YEGs Podcast](https://basketofyegs.com/episode/2016/03/02/irfan-chaudhry-campaign-and-future-plans/)
that he would absolutely be running again in the next general election.

But, like the 31 candidates who also went home unsuccessful last year, he has not yet filed his intention to run in the 
election this October.

With five months before we go to the polls, many would say that it's still far too early for everyone to declare. However,
there is an important consideration not many are aware of: a candidate *must* file notice of intent to run with the city
before they may collect *any* campaign donations, or identify themselves as a candidate. Thus far, 55 candidates [have filed](https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/notice-of-intent.aspx)
city-wide.

**Jason Bale** (37): Right now I am working on building [an esports company](http://www.edmontonesports.ca/) for Edmonton and it is taking up most of my time. Aside from that, my political aspirations are more provincial and would rather commit to that, than risk causing another by-election.
