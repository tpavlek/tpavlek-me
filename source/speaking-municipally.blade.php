                        Troy's take on local politics comes from the unique cross-section of his interests in bikes, policy,
                        internet culture and a rabid and undying love of The West Wing. He <a href="/blog/2017/10/17/i-lost-the-election">tried to run for city council in 2017</a>
                        and failed very, very badly. Now he has a podcast, so take that haters, I guess.
