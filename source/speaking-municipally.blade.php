                Each week, Speaking Municipally breaks down the events of the past week, gives you an informed take on them
                dives into the context of how these decisions got made and why they matter to you.
                <br />
                All in under thirty minutes, without (we hope) being boring for any of those minutes.

                        Troy's take on local politics comes from the unique cross-section of his interests in bikes, policy,
                        internet culture and a rabid and undying love of The West Wing. He <a href="/blog/2017/10/17/i-lost-the-election">tried to run for city council in 2017</a>
                        and failed very, very badly. Now he has a podcast, so take that haters, I guess.

                        gives the podcast a unique flavour of having both hot takes and <span class="italic">facts</span>.
