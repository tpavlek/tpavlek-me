    <h2>Why should you vote for me for Edmonton City Council?</h2>

    <p>
        Stay tuned and subscribe for <a href="/newsletter">email updates</a> so you'll know when a full platform is available. In the
        meantime, here's a few reasons why I deserve your vote in October of 2017.
    </p>

    <h3>I represent a truly different choice</h3>
    <p>
        Other candidates are usually picked from businessmen, lawyers or career politicians. If we keep electing the same types
        of people, with the same background, how can we be surprised when City Hall doesn't change?
    </p>
    <p>
        As a candidate, I'm young enough that I'm not interested in a government salary while I run a business on the side
        and plan for retirement. I'm running to shape my city into somewhere I can live for the next seventy years. Short-term
        politically motivated decisions won't help me get there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Professionally, I'm a software developer. My entire job is to write computer code to take care of the junk so
        smart people like analysts and tradesmen have more time to do the complex stuff that only they can. Our city is
        wrought with technological waste, but few of the members of Council even have the understanding to identify the problem, much less fix it.
        The <strong>Metro Line</strong>? The train that has been delaying passengers and commuters in the area for several years
        after it was supposed to be done? It's being held up by a <em>software problem</em>. The warning signs for this issue
        were everywhere, but without a technologically adept council, the red flags went unnoticed.
    </p>

    <h3>I'm committed to <em>complete openness</em>, not just transparency</h3>

    <p>
        Every candidate harps about "transparency", "openness" and "accountability" to score political points, but few of
        them have concrete actions to back it up. As a developer, I built <a href="https://yegvotes.info">YEGVotes.info</a>, a
        website that lets you see your councillor's attendance at meetings, and every vote they have ever made. When I tell
        you I'm voting for something, I want you to have the tools to <em>check</em>. Can you just skip work whenever you want?
        Absolutely not. I've made attendance records at council very easy to access, because informed voters should <strong>know</strong>
        when their councillor doesn't show up for work.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I make a claim like "we reduced service on a bus route because of low ridership" you shouldn't have to trust me.
        Edmonton has an award-winning open data catalogue that allows citizens and journalists to see data the City of Edmonton
        makes available. However, currently data sets must be added to the catalogue individually, and it is a long process to do so.
        Edmonton needs to embrace an "open-first" policy for our data. If the city has data, personally-identifiable information
        should be automatically removed, and the data should be made available to the public <strong>immediately</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>I want <em>zero</em> serious collisions on our roadways</h3>
    <p>
        The City of Edmonton claims to employ a strategy called "Vision Zero" - but they've been halfhearted at best. The entire
        program feels like a bait-and-switch. I believe in true <strong>Vision Zero</strong>, which means that <em>no</em> loss of
        life in our roadways is acceptable. True Vision Zero believes that <strong>humans will make errors, and roadway design should minimize those errors</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        What does that mean in terms of policy? Well, on inner-city streets, we have to <em>slow down</em>. I will advocate for
        40km/h speed limits in <em>residential neighbourhoods</em> as I am already doing in my own neighbourhood of Hazeldean.
        But that means that roadway design must change as well. Large, flat, straight roadways should not exist where cars are mingling
        with pedestrians, as the natural feeling on those roadways is to go fast. Every mode of transportation needs their own space,
        including pedestrians, cyclists and cars and roadway design needs to make interaction points safe and convenient. Tools like raised intersections,
        extended curbs, well-marked crosswalks and traffic calming in congested areas can all be applied to make the road safer for all
        users, <em>without</em> sending a photo radar bill in the mail to <a href="https://tpavlek.me/blog/2016/01/25/edmonton-photo-radar-2015-stats/">500,000 people a year.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the same vein, our large freeways that were <em>designed</em> for high speeds without pedestrian interaction need to be
        looked at. If traffic can safely move faster on those roadways it <em>should</em>. Photo Radar should be a last resort to
        make sure our <em>people</em> are safe. That means it should be deployed in areas with low-speeds and high pedestrian traffic.
        Penalising commuters on the Henday for moving safely with the flow of traffic is not what vision zero is about.
    </p>

    <h3>I'm ready to <em>dedicate</em> and <em>communicate</em></h3>
    <p>
        I don't have kids. I'm sure I will one day, but this decade is for myself and my own life, not raising another. As many of you
        with families know, when you're raising kids you want to spend an incredible amount of time with them. Their needs become
        priority number one. I can serve Edmonton as priority number one - and whether I'm elected or not, making Edmonton better is something
        I'll continue to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have the tools to communicate better. I'm adept at web-development and blogging for people who like to read their news on a website.
        I host a <a href="https://basketofyegs.com">local municipal politics podcast</a>, so I can keep constituents updated on their drive
        to work. For those on Twitter, I tweet regularly and engage in discussions there. My email inbox gets prompt replies and, of course,
        I have a mouth and a face so good ol' regular conversations are in my wheel house. I know there's not just one way to
        communicate anymore, and I'm ready to engage with my constituents <em>however</em> they would like to talk to me.
    </p>

    <h3>And so much more...</h3>
    <p>
        Over the next year, I'll be doing my best to win your vote, so stay tuned. If you have any questions or would like to chat,
        feel free to drop me an email and we can set something up: <a href="mailto:troy@tpavlek.me">troy@tpavlek.me</a>. As well, you can sign up for the newsletter below and keep updated.
